    <h2>Preparation times:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> 10 Minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Cooking:</strong>3 Hours</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>600g Ground beef (not too lean)</li>
        <li>250g Minced pork (not too lean)</li>
        <li>700ml Thick tomato sauce + water</li>
        <li>1 Small white onion</li>
        <li>70g Celery</li>
        <li>70g Carrots</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>100ml Red wine (actually, white is good too)</li>
        <li>1 sprig of fresh rosemary <em>(optional)</em></li>
        <li>50ml Whole milk</li>
        <li>Salt as needed</li>
        <li>Black pepper as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First of all wash and chop the onion, celery and carrot into small pieces, and put them in a tall and capacious steel pot.</li>
        <li>Add the oil and fry slowly for about 5 minutes, at this stage you can add the finely chopped rosemary.</li>
        <li>Add the minced beef and pork, and crumble it with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Let it brown for about 10 minutes over medium heat, until all the juices of the meat are dry.</li>
        <li>Add the wine and simmer over high heat.</li>
        <p><strong>The trick:</strong> The wine must evaporate completely, it is in this phase that all the aromas blend and there must be no trace of alcohol that could give an unpleasant taste to the Ragù!</p>
        <li>As soon as the alcohol has completely evaporated, you can add the tomato puree.</li>
        <li>Fill the empty puree bottle with water, shake and pour half the water into the saucepan with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Boil and transfer the saucepan of your Ragu Bolognese to one of the smallest burners you have!</li>
        <li>The ragù must cook slowly for about 3 hours with the lid on, stir occasionally. Gradually pour the remaining water, when you see that the sauce becomes less liquid.</li>
        <li>At the end of cooking, add the milk, as tradition dictates, to dampen the taste of the tomato, but if you don't want to, you can also not add it! Season with salt and add a pinch of pepper.</li>
        <li>The final result must be a dry but at the same time creamy mixture!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips for storage:</h2>
    <p>The ragù can be kept perfectly in the refrigerator for 3 - 4 days closed in an airtight container. You can also freeze it in practical single portions to always have it ready! in this case, defrosting it at room temperature is advisable!</p>
