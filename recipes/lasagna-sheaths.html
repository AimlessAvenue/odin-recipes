    <h1>Fresh Lasagna sheaths</h1>
    <h2>A brief introduction:</h2>
    <p>Homemade fresh pasta is a traditional basic dough typical of Italian cuisine made of eggs and flour! For this reason it is also called <em>Egg Pasta</em>! 
    </p>
    <p>    
    Once a soft and elastic ball is obtained, it is rolled out with a rolling pin to obtain a thin sheet; from which many types of fresh pasta can be obtained: such as <em>Tagliatelle, Tagliolini, Pappardelle</em>; large squares of puff pastry for <a href="./lasagna.html">Lasagne</a>, it is also a base for <em>Cannelloni</em> or puff pastry for <em>Ravioli, Tortellini and Cappelletti</em>! From the leftover cuttings, simple <em>Quadrucci</em> or <em>Maltagliati</em> can be made! 
    </p>
    <p>
    Follow this Fresh Pasta Recipe to make a perfect homemade Pasta: with a rough and porous texture, but at the same time soft and tasty, with an exquisite taste just like that of grandmother or bought in italian bakeries and in the best delicatessens!
    </p>
    <p>
        Like any traditional recipe, there are numerous variations: like the green one with spinach, colored with cuttlefish ink or flavored with herbs and many others! What we will make today is the <strong>original recipe of fresh egg pasta</strong>, the classic version handed down by my family! 
    </p>
    <p>    
        It is an easy preparation, the dough requires a basic rule: <em>for every 100 grams of flour, 1 egg is added</em>. The perfect combination is to use soft wheat flour '00 and a small percentage of durum wheat flour that gives the right porosity and consistency! It is kneaded quickly by hand and after a short rest at room temperature, the dough is rolled out. In this case with a rolling pin as tradition dictates; but if you have it available, you can use a <em>pasta machine</em> to make quick fresh pasta! 
    </p>
    <p>    
        Once the fresh pasta is made, it should be allowed to dry a little and immediately cooked. Alternatively, you can keep it in the fridge for a short time, or you can freeze it!

    <h2>Preparation times:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 5 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients for 300g of dough:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g Wheat flour type '00</li>
        <li>50g Wheat type '0</li>
        <li>2 Large whole eggs</li>
        <li>Salt as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First of all, use a rather large, dry and clean wooden pastry board (alternatives: marble, plastic) and a kitchen tarot <em>(a sort of scraper, often used for pizza)</em></li>
        <li>Place the flour in a "heap" shape (Create a sort of concavity where to insert the ingredients), insert the eggs and salt in the center.</li>
        <li>With a fork, beat the eggs, as if making an omelette, gradually incorporating the flour on the sides, forming a cream.</li>
        <li>Incorporate more and more flour towards the center. Gradually the consistency of liquid eggs becomes creamy.</li>
        <li>Put the remaining flour on the egg cream until all the dough is covered.</li>
        <li>Scrape the bottom so that the egg cream does not stick to the wood and mix coarsely.</li>
        <li>When the dough takes shape and no longer sticks, proceed to knead with your hands, vigorously, pulling and stretching the dough.</li>
        <p><strong>The trick:</strong> As a rule, if you have chosen large eggs, the doses should be perfect and the dough is compact, but widely workable. <br> If at the beginning the dough is hard, do not worry, continue to knead, pull and roll out. Gradually the dough will become softer and smoother. <br> Only if you have used medium-sized eggs, therefore smaller, it is possible that <strong>the dough is too hard</strong>, in that case <strong>add 1 tablespoon of warm water</strong>.</p>
        <li>After working the dough for at least 5 minutes, it should finally have taken on a smooth and soft consistency. Shape it into a ball and wrap it in cling film.</li>
        <li>Finally let it rest for 30 - 40 minutes at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
