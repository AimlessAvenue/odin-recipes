    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The tradition of lasagna originated in Emilia Romagna, and from there it has become one of the symbols of Italian cuisine throughout the world. Abroad, lasagne alla bolognese, made with bechamel and meat sauce, is well known. The Neapolitan version of this recipe includes among its ingredients tomato sauce, mozzarella, meatballs and Roman ricotta cheese. In Liguria, pesto is used as a sauce, while in Venice the sauce is replaced with red radicchio. The lasagna you eat depends on where you are.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First of all, make the Bolognese sauce</li>
        <li>Then make the puff pastry. I recommend that you carve the rectangles directly to the size of your pan.</li>
        <li>Finally, prepare the Bechamel by mixing butter or oil with the flour on the heat, slowly adding milk and stirring constantly until the mixture is soft and smooth. Finally, add salt and flavor. Cover with a contact film.</li>
        <li>Once the bases are ready, nice and cold, you can assemble your lasagna.</li>
        <li>Add a ladle of rag첫 to a pan and then one or more sheets for lasagna to cover the base.</li>
        <li>Then add two ladles of meat sauce and a few spoonfuls of bechamel, finally add a sprinkling of Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Now add a new sheet of lasagna and continue following the order, from step 5.</li>
        <li>For the last layer, cover with two ladles of meat sauce, a few tablespoons of bechamel and finally a sprinkle of Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Finally cover the pan with aluminum foil, in this way the ingredients will blend perfectly without burning immediately.</li>
        <li>Bake in a static oven, hot at 180 째 in the central part, for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <p><strong>The trick:</strong><em>Remember that the trick is the temperature, which <strong>Must be 180째</strong>. Ideally, the oven should be preheated,and if you have the option to choose various settings, heat the central part of the oven.</em></p>
        <li>After the indicated time, remove the aluminum foil, transfer the tray to the upper level and cook for another 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional:</strong>The last 5 minutes turn on the grill and raise to 200 째 to achieve the mighty crust!</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and leave to cool for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enojoy your lasagna!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips for storage:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can keep cooked in the fridge for 2 - 3 days, reheat at the moment or freeze!</li>
        <li>Alternatively, you can prepare your lasagna well in advance and keep it in the fridge until ready to cook!</li>
    </ul>
