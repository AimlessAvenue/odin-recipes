    <h1>Fresh Lasagna sheets</h1>
    <h2>A brief introduction:</h2>
    <p>Homemade fresh pasta is a traditional basic dough typical of Italian cuisine made of eggs and flour! For this reason it is also called <em>Egg Pasta</em>! 
    </p>
    <p>    
    Once a soft and elastic ball is obtained, it is rolled out with a rolling pin to obtain a thin sheet; from which many types of fresh pasta can be obtained: such as <em>Tagliatelle, Tagliolini, Pappardelle</em>; large squares of puff pastry for <a href="./lasagna.html">Lasagne</a>, it is also a base for <em>Cannelloni</em> or puff pastry for <em>Ravioli, Tortellini and Cappelletti</em>! From the leftover cuttings, simple <em>Quadrucci</em> or <em>Maltagliati</em> can be made! 
    </p>
    <p>
    Follow this Fresh Pasta Recipe to make a perfect homemade Pasta: with a rough and porous texture, but at the same time soft and tasty, with an exquisite taste just like that of grandmother or bought in italian bakeries and in the best delicatessens!
    </p>
    <p>
        Like any traditional recipe, there are numerous variations: like the green one with spinach, colored with cuttlefish ink or flavored with herbs and many others! What we will make today is the <strong>original recipe of fresh egg pasta</strong>, the classic version handed down by my family! 
    </p>
    <p>    
        It is an easy preparation, the dough requires a basic rule: <em>for every 100 grams of flour, 1 egg is added</em>. The perfect combination is to use soft wheat flour '00 and a small percentage of durum wheat flour that gives the right porosity and consistency! It is kneaded quickly by hand and after a short rest at room temperature, the dough is rolled out. In this case with a rolling pin as tradition dictates; but if you have it available, you can use a <em>pasta machine</em> to make quick fresh pasta! 
    </p>
    <p>    
        Once the fresh pasta is made, it should be allowed to dry a little and immediately cooked. Alternatively, you can keep it in the fridge for a short time, or you can freeze it!

    <h2>Preparation times:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 5 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients for 300g of dough:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g Wheat flour type '00</li>
        <li>50g Wheat type '0</li>
        <li>2 Large whole eggs</li>
        <li>Salt as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First of all, use a rather large, dry and clean wooden pastry board (alternatives: marble, plastic) and a kitchen tarot <em>(a sort of scraper, often used for pizza)</em></li>
        <li>Place the flour in a "heap" shape (Create a sort of concavity where to insert the ingredients), insert the eggs and salt in the center.</li>
        <li>With a fork, beat the eggs, as if making an omelette, gradually incorporating the flour on the sides, forming a cream.</li>
        <li>Incorporate more and more flour towards the center. Gradually the consistency of liquid eggs becomes creamy.</li>
        <li>Put the remaining flour on the egg cream until all the dough is covered.</li>
        <li>Scrape the bottom so that the egg cream does not stick to the wood and mix coarsely.</li>
        <li>When the dough takes shape and no longer sticks, proceed to knead with your hands, vigorously, pulling and stretching the dough.</li>
        <p><strong>The trick:</strong> As a rule, if you have chosen large eggs, the doses should be perfect and the dough is compact, but widely workable. <br> If at the beginning the dough is hard, do not worry, continue to knead, pull and roll out. Gradually the dough will become softer and smoother. <br> Only if you have used medium-sized eggs, therefore smaller, it is possible that <strong>the dough is too hard</strong>, in that case <strong>add 1 tablespoon of warm water</strong>.</p>
        <li>After working the dough for at least 5 minutes, it should finally have taken on a smooth and soft consistency. Shape it into a ball and wrap it in cling film.</li>
        <li>Finally let it rest for 30 - 40 minutes at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Now you have to choose to either:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Roll out the dough by hand</h4></li>
        <ol>
            <p><strong>The trick:</strong> If you do not have a very large and long pastry board, it is better to divide the dough in half. This is to prevent the dough from falling off the work surface during processing, risking breaking and bending.</p>
            <li>Wrap the part of the dough that you are not going to roll out immediately in the film.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour the work surface with '00 flour. Also flour the wooden rolling pin.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough vigorously by stretching the center and all sides, already trying to give it the shape of a long rectangle. Whatever type of fresh pasta you are going to make, the rectangle is always good.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough often, lifting it to prevent it from sticking to the top. A pinch of flour every turn will be necessary, but be careful not to overdo it!</li>
            <p><strong>The trick:</strong> The best sheets are the soft ones, which have been made with as little flour as possible.</p>
            <li>Continue to roll out until you get a very thin sheet <em>(the thinner the sheet the better your pasta will be!)</em> The sheet must be almost transparent, so as to glimpse the veins of your wooden pastry board.</li>
            <p>The ideal thickness should be around 0.5mm</p>
        </ol>
        <li><h4>Roll out the dough with the pasta machine</h4></li>
        <ol>
            <li>First of all divide the dough into 4 parts. 3 of which you close them in the film.</li>
            <li>flatten the piece of dough with your hands so that it thins to at least 4 -5 mm, insert it into the slot of the lightly floured machine, initially setting a medium distance between the rollers.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough 3-4 times by folding it back on itself. Decrease the distance between the rollers to obtain a sheet as thin as possible and start pulling the sheet again, folding it back on itself, taking care to flour (very little) each time, repeat the operation until the sheet is smooth and perfectly flat.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
    <h3>Once your <i>Sfoglia</i> is ready, you can make the fresh pasta format that suits you best.</h3>
    <h4>How to cut the pastry for lasagna:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the thin sheet to about 0.5 mm thick, trying to give your pastry a rectangular shape.</li>
        <li>Proceed to cut the left side and the bottom of your pastry with a clean cut, in order to obtain straight sides</li>
        <li>At this point, to make your Lasagna, make rectangles (typical ones are 15 cm X 20 cm). </li>
        <li>Let your lasagna dry for about 20 minutes before cooking it. If you want to stack them, just sprinkle each rectangle with a pinch of flour.</li>
        <p><strong>Nothing is thrown away in the kitchen!</strong> With the leftover pieces of fresh pasta sheet, you can make <i>maltagliati</i> ("badly cut" in english)!<br>Coarsely cut the pieces of leftover dough into several pieces, trying to keep a more or less equal size to ensure uniform cooking.</p>
